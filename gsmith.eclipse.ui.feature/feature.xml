   <description>
      This feature includes eclipse functionality that I found useful:
- Toggle read/write state command for files
- A decorator for readonly files 
- Setting the eclipse window size
- Thumbnail decorator for image files
- A simple image viewer
- Screenshots
- A scratch pad text view
